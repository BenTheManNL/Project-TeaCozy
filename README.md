# Project: Tea Cozy
Project for Codecademy

This is a Project made for the <strong>Full-Stack Engineer</strong> Program at Codecademy.

I had to <strong>re-create</strong> a webpage made by codecademy, using only a <strong>Design spec</strong>.

It was a Project to test if i could make a webpage <strong>responsive</strong> using <strong>Flex-Box</strong>, 
and if i could re-create a webpage by only seeing it. Using my current HTML&CSS Skills.

I <strong>re-created</strong> it exactly, and this is the outcome.

LEFT= The Design-Spec i got. RIGHT= My Re-Creation.
